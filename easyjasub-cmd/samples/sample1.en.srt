1
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,472
The Kingdom of Fiore...

2
00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:10,746
It's a stable neutral country
with a population of 17 million.

3
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:13,228
It is a world filled with magic.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,132
Magic is traded like common goods.

5
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:20,080
It has become a part of daily life.

6
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:24,778
And there are people
who use magic to make a living.

7
00:00:24,813 --> 00:00:28,471
Those people are called "Mages".

8
00:00:29,292 --> 00:00:35,027
Mages belong to various guilds
and perform their jobs on request.

9
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:39,796
Countless guilds have been formed
in this country.

10
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:44,001
And there's a certain mage guild
located in a city.

11
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:50,941
In past times... no, even now,
it's still creating legends...

12
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:52,122
Its name is...

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,862
...Fairy Tail.

14
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,714
Fairy, where are you going

15
00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:07,219
I'll collect all the light
to make your future shine

16
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:17,055
Oh yeah,
can you hear my voice?

17
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:21,675
Oh yeah, I'm screaming it out
with my virile voice

18
00:01:22,052 --> 00:01:26,126
Oh yeah, I'll scream
until my voice reaches your heart

19
00:01:26,464 --> 00:01:30,090
Oh yeah, oh yeah

20
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,929
Like the moon
and sun's high touch

21
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,837
Didn't you forget anything?

22
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,139
I won't be able
to find what I desire

23
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:48,163
If your amusing presence
isn't by my side

24
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:52,594
Snowing, the times
we got close to each other

25
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:57,105
Brought forth
your honest smile

26
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,390
Fairy, where are you going

27
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:07,964
I'll collect all the light
to make your future shine

28
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,989
Don't say goodbye

29
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,521
The port city, Hargeon.

30
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:36,102
U-Um, mister?

31
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:39,082
Natsu!
We've arrived at Hargeon!

32
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,399
Get up! Get up!

33
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:41,648
I-Is he alright?

34
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:43,748
Yes!
This happens all the time.

35
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:47,669
It is hopeless.
I will never ride a train ever again...

36
00:02:47,704 --> 00:02:51,706
If the information is correct,
Salamander should be in this town.

37
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:53,180
Let's go.

38
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,166
L-Let me rest
for a little bit...

39
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:04,478
Save me!!

40
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:08,939
It departed.

41
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:14,714
Fairy Tail

42
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:18,787
What?

43
00:03:18,822 --> 00:03:22,637
This is the only magic store
in this town?

44
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:26,623
Yes. Because fishing is more prosperous
than magic in this town.

45
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:30,734
Only 10% of the citizens
can use magic.

46
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:34,426
This store
is mainly for traveling mages.

47
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:37,200
Ah~
I guess I came here for nothing.

48
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:40,056
Well, well, before saying that
take a look at this, please.

49
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:42,357
I have lots of new goods, too!

50
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:45,993
This Color Magic is probably
the most popular one among girls!

51
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:49,229
You can change your clothes' color
depending on your mood.

52
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,824
Just say "Change"!

53
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,170
I already have it.

54
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:56,025
Youhou!

55
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,961
I am looking
for powerful Gate Keys.
